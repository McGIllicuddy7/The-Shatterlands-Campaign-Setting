The Shatterlands are known as such because it is theorized that the world used to be a single very large continent and something eons ago turned it into a network of islands instead. Everyone calls it that in whatever their langauge is and there is a 
similar understanding that all the people of the world were once one before being scattered to the winds. Other than that essentially everyone disagrees.

There are 4 main cultural groups in the Shatterlands: The Kzin, The Franel, The Artemi, and The Set
The Kzin are mostly Shifters and Tabaxi and generally live in the North and West, The Franel are generally Dwarfs, Gnomes and Golaiths and they generally live in the South and West. '
The Artemi are mostly Elves, Orcs and Shifters and they generally live in the north and east. The Set are mostly humans, orcs and goblins, and they live in the South and East.

Kzin are mostly Charnites although Avoritism is growing significantly among them 
The Franel mostly followers of the Oaken Path but nearly every religion is a sizeable fraction of their population
The Artemi are nearly all followers of the Left Hand Path 
The Set are about half and half left hand Path followers and Avoritites

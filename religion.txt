Every culture in the Shatterlands has their own religion and even within them every person in those cultures has their own interpretation of those religions. Generally speaking there are 4 major religions in the world though. Charninism, 
Avoritism, The Left Hand Path, and The Oaken Path. 

Charninism:  Holds that the world was created by at least a dozen gods(it varies by culture) and that those gods have conflicts and crises and such and are essentially human in their behavior if not nature. 
Avoritism: Holds that Calumn is the ultimate god and the wellspring of all life. An offshooot of Charninism.
The Left Hand Path: Witches, 
The Oaken Path: Druids
